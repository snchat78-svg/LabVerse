# LabVerse Next Work & Source Closure Register — 2026-11-10

## Work completed in this unit

### PDF preservation / no-repeat protection

- Added `data/catalogues/source_pdf_registry_2026_11_10.csv` with nine source identities and explicit `no_repeat_upload=TRUE`.
- Added `docs/SOURCE_PDF_ARCHIVE_REGISTER_2026_11_10.md` documenting original names, file sizes, page counts, SHA-256, existing derived catalogues, availability and evidence limits.
- Recorded verified hashes for the currently accessible unique originals:
  - Biology kit manual code 13163: 20,028,910 bytes, 141 pages, SHA-256 `c6303b94bcb9a94d08a54aabf56f22d94aaf87f296d083917ab8b6fb6a6bc086`; two uploaded copies are byte-identical.
  - Chemistry `MSCL_copy.pdf`: 19,798,501 bytes, 65 pages, SHA-256 `db08a381ed1d349dc6ee292c05610d74683cd65b1308223e8472cb4ca2fe5b9d`.
  - Biology with microscope prior upload: 59,620,970 bytes, 199 pages, SHA-256 `c88112e9013d37028091214dc5473eb81af6bf6cc54e71b266aee779826517d2`; existing 177-row catalogue retained.
  - RBSE XI 2026–27: 23,343,499 bytes, 155 pages, SHA-256 `a1899f74bdf72303c0ada379c96b515f11ac3e61ba0d10c30f146b56e345a8c5`.
  - RBSE XII 2026–27: 18,279,805 bytes, 169 pages, SHA-256 `2249c6233817ba625460a97b1fab829d57d5ce6842a19bb12be80794c40e7e34`.
- Recorded prior Biology-without-microscope and Physics PDF submissions as acknowledged and no-repeat; exact old filenames/hashes are not surfaced in the current file index. No missing hash was invented.
- Updated the five-document NCERT intake manifest and Phase 1 source gap register so the old upload instructions are superseded. No further upload request should be made for previously supplied sources.

### Biology manual check

- Rendered and visually inspected PDF pages 28–29 (printed pages xxvii–xxviii) of Biology manual 13163.
- Confirmed 58 numbered chemicals/reagents/stains and the manual note that they are **not supplied with the kit** and are managed by the institution/school/teacher/related staff.
- Preserved the source's printed item-37 label `Petroleum Rther` exactly rather than silently normalising it.
- Stored the 58-entry list at `data/catalogues/ncert_biology_manual_reagents_58.csv`.

### Dashboard validation track

- Playwright Chromium desktop/mobile smoke suite passed **9/9 groups** on commit `28f8452d1409b086e0a0c80244a7e4874aafaf`: dashboard overview/counts; Physics search/tap/reset; HTML5 drag/drop; practical-to-inventory navigation; candidate setup placeholder; Fortin barometer gap; Chemistry reagent boundary; Biology chemical/class/open-project boundary; mobile navigation.
- Inventory/source-registry/schema integrity workflow also passed on the same commit. Browser run: https://github.com/snchat78-svg/LabVerse/actions/runs/42747870645. Data checks: https://github.com/snchat78-svg/LabVerse/actions/runs/42747870414.
- Practical-source coverage: 169/171 task records have candidate item links. Physics 79/80; Chemistry 41/41; Biology 49/50. All 287 subject-distinct mapped source-item IDs resolve; 0 unresolved IDs. Explicit unmatched tasks are Fortin barometer (not in current 106-row Physics manual register) and the open-ended Biology teacher-assigned investigatory project (no fixed apparatus list).

## Repository phase status

- Phase 0: DONE (documentation baseline only).
- Phase 1 / Phase 1.1: IN PROGRESS; source authentication, remaining no-microscope/Physics record recovery, item-level audit, rights, safety and expert review remain open.
- Phase 2: PARTIAL only for the dashboard-facing read model; scientific domain contracts and result engines remain blocked.
- Phase 3: PARTIAL; dashboard prototype and catalogue checks exist; production React/TypeScript/Vite foundation not complete.
- Phase 4: IN PROGRESS; three-subject navigation and inventory dashboard prototype committed.
- Phase 5 onward: NOT STARTED; no real 3D assets or scientific action/simulation engines.

## Remaining work register

| ID | Remaining work | Current evidence | Next safe action |
|---|---|---|---|
| SRC-01 | Recover Biology without-microscope previously supplied PDF/catalogue | Prior upload acknowledged; no current hash/catalogue surfaced | Search older project records/attachments internally; do not ask user to resend; do not infer variant differences |
| SRC-02 | Recover Physics previously supplied PDFs and exact procurement-spec identity | User confirms previous submission; 106-row Physics manual register and 80-task crosswalk exist | Recover earlier raw source/derived register internally; keep manual and current procurement specification separate |
| SRC-03 | Reconcile current MSCL procurement PDF/BOQ and reagent supply status | MSCL_copy candidate hash + 55-row index; historical 124 reagent labels | Continue from current candidate and old registers; exact official revision/BOQ and supply/formulation details remain a source gap |
| SRC-04 | Finish Biology 177-row page/visual audit and map the manual | 177-row catalogue, 50 task IDs, manual 60 exercises | Audit index-only visual cards/slides/specimens page by page; preserve provenance and taxonomy review |
| SRC-05 | Finish source-to-asset/model/test traceability for all subjects | 171 task-index rows across six packs | Resolve every remaining apparatus, sample, reagent, measurement and evidence gap; keep design-only status |
| UI-01 | Complete desktop/mobile Chromium smoke | 9/9 Playwright Chromium groups pass on commit `28f8452d1409b086e0a0c80244a7e4874aafaf` | DONE — maintain regression workflow on dashboard changes |
| UI-02 | Publish live free dashboard | GitHub Pages workflow and setup guide exist; Pages is not enabled yet | One-time repository Settings → Pages → Source GitHub Actions, then run deploy workflow |
| UI-03 | Build real 3D workbench | Current bench uses 2D placeholders | Start real asset scene only after dashboard smoke and asset data contract are stable |
| SCI-01 | Implement validated Physics/Chemistry/Biology scientific engines | Models/rules not implemented | Keep Phase 1 and scientific evidence gates; do not produce simulated results from unreviewed entries |
| GOV-01 | Rights, safety and subject-expert sign-off | Open across source families and practicals | Complete per-item/per-task review before VERIFIED_FOR_USE or physical procedures |

## Important storage truth

GitHub now contains the PDF source register, hashes, extracted catalogues and evidence boundaries. The original PDF binaries themselves are **not committed to the repository**. Accessible originals remain in ChatGPT conversation/Library storage. This is explicitly recorded so future work resumes from the existing source records and does not request repeat uploads.

## Next single action

Start the production React/TypeScript/Vite codebase foundation (Phase 3) and migrate the tested three-subject Dashboard into it. Preserve the static preview, PDF source registry, no-repeat rules, candidate evidence labels and browser regression tests.


## 2026-11-10 — Practical-to-inventory navigation and candidate setup delivered

### Completed
- 169/171 subject task rows now have candidate source-item links; all 287 subject-distinct linked item IDs resolve with no broken source IDs.
- Dashboard task details show candidate links, open them in the inventory tray, disclose the two unmatched task reasons, and offer mapped candidate setup as placeholders.
- Playwright Chromium smoke: 9/9 groups PASS. Source/inventory/schema checks: PASS.
- Verified commit: `28f8452d1409b086e0a0c80244a7e4874aafaf` (repository run refs above).

### Remaining / next
1. **Phase 3:** create production React/TypeScript/Vite app foundation and migrate Dashboard components into it.
2. **Phase 4:** finish polished Dashboard navigation and responsive subject workspaces after migration.
3. **Phase 5:** implement real 3D object scene, with original asset manifests/low-poly apparatus instead of placeholder cards.
4. **Phase 6+:** deterministic action runtime, then separate Chemistry/Physics/Biology validated models.
5. Continue Phase 1 in parallel: recover prior no-microscope/Physics attachment records internally (never re-upload request), finish Biology visual/manual audit, MSCL current procurement/BOM, rights/safety/expert reviews.
